# Git Setup
Repository contains a 'sane' and base git configuration setup, along with a 'best practice' global git ignore for a number of languages and build tools.


## Getting Started

Run `setup.sh`, this will symlink gitconfig, global_gitignore, better-branch files to their proper locations.


Show all aliases declared in the gitconfig via termianl `git als`
